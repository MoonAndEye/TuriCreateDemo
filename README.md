There are two demo projects, one is judge the picture is Kaneshiro or not. The other one is judge the picture is soup or rice.

The model was create by Apple's package - Turi Create. This makes you easy to build a machine learning model very easy. 

After deploy the model to your app, you can use Core ML framework to do lots of things, such as object detection, image classification, style transfer, etc.....

Your can find the sample Python code in `JupyterNotebook` folder. After change the `dataset` you can build your own models.

Have fun~
